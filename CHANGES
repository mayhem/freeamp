Changes for Linux version 1.2:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added assembly decoder optimizations, input and output buffering. FreeAmp
  should now be able to play audio uninterrupted, unless the load
  on the machine gets too great. FreeAmp is now much less processor 
  intensive, while consuming more memory.

- Added support for SHOUTcast, HTTP and RTP streaming. You can now specify
  a file, an http://, or a rtp:// on the command line. For more information
  on SHOUTcast, please see http://icecast.linuxpower.org or
  http://www.shoutcast.com

- Logging support. Using the Logging, LogInput, LogDecode properties
  the user can now log debug information and errors to the file freeamp.log.
  This will allow the freeamp team to debug problems with versions of FreeAmp
  in the field.

- VBR stream support. FreeAmp handles VBR streams correctly. It might
  have done this in previous versions too, but it does it better now. :-)

- stdin support. To accept an mp3 stream from stdin, invoke freeamp like
  this:

      freeamp file://- < myfile.mp3

- Added properties for logging and buffering. See README for details.

- Added autoplay support.
