The installation of FreeAmp is fairly straight forward.


Linux:
	Under Linux you must first build the binary:

	./configure
	make 

	then install it (by default, /usr/local/bin  which can be 
	changed by providing the --bindir switch on the configure command 
	line.  do a ./configure --help for more info) :

	make install  
	  (freeamp is installed to $(bindir), as set above)
	  (plugins are installed to $(libdir)/freeamp/plugins, as set
	  above)

Windows:
	In addition to the makefiles provided for the unix platforms
	project files are located in the base\win32\prj directory. As of
	the first release only MS Visual C++ 5.0 project files are 
	provided. Feel free to add other development environments
	such as Borland. 

	Under MS VC++ you should only have to open the project file
	and build it. The output will go to either the win32\prj\gui 
	or win32\prj\console directory, depending on which project 
	you are using. There are no special installation instructions.
