The installation of FreeAmp is fairly straight forward.


Linux:
	Under Linux you must first build the binary:

	./configure
	make ; make

	unfortunately, there is an issue with the build that is
	currently open which makes you have to type make twice.  If
	you are a Make and Autoconf wizard, we'd appreciate a fix.
	Otherwise, please check out the Tar-O-Matic soon.

	then install it (by default, /usr/local/bin  which can be 
	changed by providing the --bindir switch on the configure command 
	line.  do a ./configure --help for more info) :

	make install

	you may also wish to enable mpg123 compatability mode by
	invoking freeamp as 'mpg123'  (i.e. do a ln -s freeamp mpg123
	to make a symbolic link, then do a ./mpg123)  This makes it
	useful as a decoder for such gui mpg123 frontends as GQmpeg.

	Check out GQmpeg at

Windows:
	In addition to the makefiles provided for the unix platforms
	project files are located in the base\win32\prj directory. As of
	the first release only MS Visual C++ 5.0 project files are 
	provided. Feel free to add other development environments
	such as Borland. 

	Under MS VC++ you should only have to open the project file
	and build it. The output will go to either the win32\prj\gui 
	or win32\prj\console directory, depending on which project 
	you are using. There are no special installation instructions.
