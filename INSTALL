The installation of FreeAmp is fairly straight forward.


Linux:
	Under Linux you must first build the binary:

	./configure
	make 

	then install it (by default, /usr/local/bin  which can be 
	changed by providing the --bindir switch on the configure command 
	line.  do a ./configure --help for more info) :

	make install

	plugins (located in the plugins directory where you built
	freeamp) must be copied to a directory named 'plugins'.
	This 'plugins' directory is a subdirectory of either:
	a) a directory in the built-in seach path:
	   .:~/.freeamp:LIBDIR/freeamp
	   (where LIBDIR is either /usr/local/lib or the one you
	   specified as --libdir= to ./configure)
	b) the search path specified by the environment variable
	   FREEAMP_PATH

	you may also wish to enable mpg123 compatability mode by
	invoking freeamp as 'mpg123'  (i.e. do a ln -s freeamp mpg123
	to make a symbolic link, then do a ./mpg123)  This makes it
	useful as a decoder for such gui mpg123 frontends as GQmpeg.

Windows:
	In addition to the makefiles provided for the unix platforms
	project files are located in the base\win32\prj directory. As of
	the first release only MS Visual C++ 5.0 project files are 
	provided. Feel free to add other development environments
	such as Borland. 

	Under MS VC++ you should only have to open the project file
	and build it. The output will go to either the win32\prj\gui 
	or win32\prj\console directory, depending on which project 
	you are using. There are no special installation instructions.
