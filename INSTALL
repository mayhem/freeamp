The installation of FreeAmp is fairly straight forward.


Linux:
	You'll need perl and nasm in order to compile the latest MP3
	decoder assembly optimizations.  If you don't have nasm, you can
	still compile successfully, but you'll only be able to use some of
	the older optimizations written in gas.

	Under Linux you must first build the binary:

	./configure
	make 

	then install it (by default, /usr/local/bin  which can be 
	changed by providing the --bindir switch on the configure command 
	line.  do a ./configure --help for more info) :

	make install  
	  (freeamp is installed to $(bindir), as set above)
	  (plugins are installed to $(libdir)/freeamp/plugins, as set
	  above)

Windows:
  Build:
	The main project file is located in the base\win32\prj directory. 
	The file freeamp.dsw organizes all the sub-projects and builds 
	all the modules. As of the first release only MS Visual C++ 5.0 
	project files and nmake makefiles are provided. Feel free to add 
	other development environments such as Borland and Metrowerks. 

	Under MS VC++ you should only have to open the project file
	and build it. The output will go to base\win32\prj. You can 
	run freeamp from here or move it to another directory.
	Just make sure the plugins directory is in the same 
	location.

  Install:   
	In order to build the installer you will need InstallShield
	Pro version 5.0 or later. The InstallShield project file is
	in the install/win32 directory.

	The first thing you need to do is run the Media Build Wizard
	under the Build menu. Choose the package you wish to create
	(FreeAmp 32bit Install, etc.) and click "Next" until it builds.

	Next, compile the installer from the Build menu. This will place
	the install files in:

	install/win32/Media/<Package>/Disk Images/disk1

	you can run the setup.exe file or use the PackageForTheWeb 
	utility to create a self-extracting installer.

  NOTE:
	The InstallShield installer looks for the program files in the 
	base\win32\prj directory so if you want to build an installer
	do not remove the files.
