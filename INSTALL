The installation of FreeAmp is fairly straight forward.


Linux:
	Under Linux you must first build the binary:

	./configure
	make 

	then install it (by default, /usr/local/bin  which can be 
	changed by providing the --bindir switch on the configure command 
	line.  do a ./configure --help for more info) :

	make install  
	  (freeamp is installed to $(bindir), as set above)
	  (plugins are installed to $(libdir)/freeamp/plugins, as set
	  above)

Windows:
  Build:
	In addition to the makefiles provided for the unix platforms
	project files are located in the base\win32\prj directory. As of
	the first release only MS Visual C++ 5.0 project files are 
	provided. Feel free to add other development environments
	such as Borland. 

	Under MS VC++ you should only have to open the project file
	and build it. The output will go to base\win32\prj. You can 
	run freeamp from here or move it to another directory.
	Just make sure the plugins directory is in the same 
	location.

  Install:   
	In order to build the installer you will need InstallShield
	Pro version 5.0 or later. The InstallShield project file is
	in the install/win32 directory.

	The first thing you need to do is run the Media Build Wizard
	under the Build menu. Choose the package you wish to create
	(FreeAmp 32bit Install, etc.) and click "Next" until it builds.

	Next, compile the installer from the Build menu. This will place
	the install files in:

	install/win32/Media/<Package>/Disk Images/disk1

	you can run the setup.exe file or use the PackageForTheWeb 
	utility to create a self-extracting installer.

  NOTE:
	The InstallShield installer looks for the program files in the 
	base\win32\prj directory so if you want to build an installer
	do not remove the files.
