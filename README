INSTALLATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

From the source:

  See the document INSTALL

From binaries:

  Run "./install-freeamp" from this directory

  Or alternatively, if you prefer to install the files manually:
    - Move freeamp to /usr/local/bin (or, somewhere else in your path)
    - Move the plugins directory (complete with contents) to
        /usr/local/lib/freeamp
    - If you do not have ALSA installed, remove alsa.pmo from the
        /usr/local/lib/freeamp/plugins directory.
    - If you do not have EsounD installed, remove esound.pmo from the
        /usr/local/lib/freeamp/plugins directory.


SETTING UP FREEAMP: (Unix only -- done automatically in Windows)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To properly setup FreeAmp, you need to set the mime-type associations
in your Web Browser. To do this in Netscape, open up the Edit menu and
select 'Preferences'. On the left pane, select 'Navigator', then 
'Applications' to get to the configuration pane where you can setup
Helper Application. Then all that needsjust click on the 'New...' button
to start adding new associations.  For all the following mime-types, fill
in the Application field to be: freeamp %s

The mimetypes that FreeAmp can handle are: 
     audio/x-mpeg     audio/x-mp3     audio/x-mpegurl   audio/x-scpls
     audio/mpeg       audio/mp3       audio/mpegurl     audio/scpls
     application/x-vnd.emusic.download_package

Just set up seperate associations for each of these mimetypes, and 
FreeAmp will be launched whenever you click on a relavent URL in your
browser.


USING FREEAMP:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

FreeAmp 2.0.1 for Win32 and Linux:

  freeamp [options] [file 1] [file 2]...

  A lot has changed since version 1.3. In version 2.0 we have an all
  new interface with easily labelled buttons.

  * My Music - Opens a music browser which will hopefully allow you
      to more easily manage your music. The "My Music" dialog allows
      you to edit the current play queue as well as persistant 
      playlists.
  * Options - Opens the preferences dialog, enabling you to control
      many features in FreeAmp.
  * Files - Allows you to immediately open files located on your
      file system.
  * Download - Opens the download manager.

  Above the button bar are the volume slider on the left and the seek
  slider on the right.

  Below the button bar are the primary audio controls, Previous Song, 
  Play/Pause, Stop, and Next Song.

  The small buttons to the left of the primary audio controls control
  shuffle and repeat modes.
