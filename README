This documents how to get you up, running and using FreeAmp.  It also
explains a bit about where we are coming from.

INSTALLATION:

  See the document INSTALL

USAGE (Unix):

  freeamp [options] [file 1] [file 2]...

  When freeamp loads, it scans for a directory 'plugins' in the path pointed to by
  the environment variable FREEAMP_PATH.  If FREEAMP_PATH is not set,
  the default path is searched:  .:~/.freeamp:$(libdir)/freeamp  where
  $(libdir) is the libdir directory set by 'configure' when freeamp
  was built.  This is usually /usr/local/lib.  

  (As a side note, the ~ (of course) means your home directory.  We grab this information
  from the environment variable $HOME, rather than parse
  /etc/passwd).  We plan to parse /etc/password later, but for now...)


USAGE (Windows):

  freeamp [options] [file 1] [file 2]...
