This documents how to get you up, running and using FreeAmp.  It also
explains a bit about where we are coming from.

FreeAmp Win32 1.0.0 (11-9-98) Usage:
  This is the new FreeAmp UI.  It is simple, clean and works well.
  The usage is as follows:

  * dragging a file (or files) onto the Player sets the playlist.
    If the player is currently playing, it will stop.
  * move between files in the playlist using the |< and >| buttons
  * pause/play again by pressing the > button
  * stop by pressing the [] buton
  * adjust the volume by clicking-and-dragging on the dial to the left of the display
  * seek in the current file by clicking-and-dragging on the dial to the right of the
    display.  This is a 'jog' mechanism in that the dial adjusts the rate of change of
    the seeking (move it a little bit vertically, and the position of the song increments 
    slowly.  move it a lot vertically, and the position of the song increments quickly.)
    let up the mouse button to move to the selected point in the song.
  * clicking on the display cycles through total time, current time and time remaining.
  * Of the six buttons to the right of the display, the upper left is
    disabled (in the future will switch between modes)
  * the upper middle minimizes the player
  * the upper right quits the player
  * the lower left cycles through Repeat Mode in the following order:
    Repeat Current Song, Repeat Playlist, Repeat off.
  * the lower middle toggles 'Shuffle' mode.
  * the lower right presents the 'Open File' dialog.  The files
    selected here will replace the playlist in the same fashion as drag-n-drop

INSTALLATION:

  See the document INSTALL

USAGE (Unix):

  freeamp [options] [file 1] [file 2]...

  When freeamp loads, it scans for a directory 'plugins' in the path pointed to by
  the environment variable FREEAMP_PATH.  If FREEAMP_PATH is not set,
  the default path is searched:  .:~/.freeamp:$(libdir)/freeamp  where
  $(libdir) is the libdir directory set by 'configure' when freeamp
  was built.  This is usually /usr/local/lib.  

USAGE (Windows):

  freeamp [options] [file 1] [file 2]...
