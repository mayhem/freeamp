INSTALLATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

From the source:

  See the document INSTALL

From binaries:

  Move freeamp to /usr/local/bin (or, somewhere else in your path)
  Move the plugins directory (complete with contents) to
    /usr/local/lib/freeamp  (see first note under the Linux section below)


USING FREEAMP:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

FreeAmp version 1.20 -- Usage:

freeamp [-ui <UI plugin name>] [-prop <PropertyName>=<PropertyValue>]
        <MP3 file/stream> [MP3 file/stream] ...

The following properties can be set:

  InputBuffer      - the size (in Kb) of the input buffer
  OutputBuffer     - the size (in Kb) of the output buffer
  BufferUpInterval - how many seconds to buffer up for streaming
  Logging          - a value of 'yes' turns on logging
  LoggingInput     - a value of 'yes' logs input events
  LoggingDecode    - a value of 'yes' logs decode events

Example command line:

   freeamp -prop OutputBuffer=256 mysong1.mp3 mysong2.mp3

Notes:

  * The default output buffer size is set to 512Kb. If you have a machine
    that is not using X, or you are constrained in the amount of memory
    you have, you can specify a smaller output buffer like:

       freeamp -prop OutputBuffer=<size>

    Where size is in kbytes.

  * To play an SHOUTcast/http stream, specify the HTTP URL on the
    command line. For example:

       freeamp http://206.178.45.2:8000    

  * To play an RTP/multicast stream, specify the RTP URL on the command
    line. Example:

       freeamp rtp://225.2.1.5:4420    

  * FreeAmp looks for the plugin directory in:
   - the current directory, then
   - ~/.freeamp, then
   - /usr/local/lib/freeamp
   _or_
   in the path specified by the environment variable FREEAMP_PATH
  
  * at the moment, the only way to modify the playlist is via the
    command line when FreeAmp is started (playlist modification will
    be in the next version)
  * Move between files in the playlist using the |< and >| buttons
  * Play by pressing the > button
  * Pause by pressing the || button
  * Stop by pressing the [] button
  * Change volume clicking and dragging the left dial
  * Seek by clicking and dragging the right dial.  This dial operates
    in a 'jog' mode.  The farther you move the dial, the faster it
    moves forward (or backward) in the song.  Drop to set the position
  * Click on the display to cycle through 'total time', 'current time'
    and 'remaining time'.
The Six buttons on the right:
  * Upper right is currently not functional (in the future it will
    switch between player modes)
  * Upper middle iconifies FreeAmp
  * Upper right closes FreeAmp
  * Lower left toggles Repeat Mode between None, Current and All
  * Lower middle toggles Shuffle Mode between On and Off
  * Lower right is currently not functional (in the future it will
    open the file-open drawer)


FreeAmp Win32 1.0.0 (11-9-98) Usage:

  freeamp [options] [file 1] [file 2]...

  * dragging a file (or files) onto the Player sets the playlist.
    If the player is currently playing, it will stop.
  * move between files in the playlist using the |< and >| buttons
  * pause/play again by pressing the > button
  * stop by pressing the [] buton
  * adjust the volume by clicking-and-dragging on the dial to the left of the display
  * seek in the current file by clicking-and-dragging on the dial to the right of the
    display.  This is a 'jog' mechanism in that the dial adjusts the rate of change of
    the seeking (move it a little bit vertically, and the position of the song increments 
    slowly.  move it a lot vertically, and the position of the song increments quickly.)
    let up the mouse button to move to the selected point in the song.
  * clicking on the display cycles through total time, current time and time remaining.
  * Of the six buttons to the right of the display, the upper left is
    disabled (in the future will switch between modes)
  * the upper middle minimizes the player
  * the upper right quits the player
  * the lower left cycles through Repeat Mode in the following order:
    Repeat Current Song, Repeat Playlist, Repeat off.
  * the lower middle toggles 'Shuffle' mode.
  * the lower right presents the 'Open File' dialog.  The files
    selected here will replace the playlist in the same fashion as drag-n-drop
