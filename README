FreeAmp is an Open Source effort to build the best digital audio
player available.  In the interest of supporting the free software
community, while at the same time fostering the growth of the online
delivery of music, GoodNoise Corporation, The Internet Record Company,
is funding both the freeamp.org domain and the efforts of three
developers: Mark B. Elrod, Brett Thomas, and Jason Woodward.

FreeAmp is being released under the GPL (www.gnu.org).  As is provided
by the GPL, all our (GoodNoise's) and your efforts toward FreeAmp will
be released back to the community at large.

The current development and release versions of FreeAmp can be found
at http://www.freeamp.org.
