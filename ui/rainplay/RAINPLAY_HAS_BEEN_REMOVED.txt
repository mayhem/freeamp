Due to the fact that the Rainplay UI has become so dated with respect to the rest of the project it has been removed in the
current repository. If you wish to retrieve the src you may use the following cvs command:

cvs get -r release-1-3-1 freeamp

this was the last stable release where Rainplay was supported.
